# Eventbrite-Notifier
Receive an email notification when an Eventbrite event changes.

Simply change main.py file to indicate which email address should be used and which events (URLs) should be periodically checked.

I like to run this on http://c9.io/ (but you can also run it locally with 'python main.py')
